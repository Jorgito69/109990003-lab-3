                    <p>
                        Kimberly "Kim" Wexler is an American retired business lawyer and public defender who worked in Albuquerque, New Mexico, currently residing in Titusville, Florida as an employee at a sprinkler manufacturer company and a volunteer at a pro bono legal services firm. She is the ex-wife and former confidant of retired lawyer and convicted criminal Jimmy McGill, whom she met while working at Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM) as an intern, and had dated for several years before their six-month marriage. Despite retiring as a lawyer, Kim's New Mexico bar card does not have an expiration date, allowing her to visit Jimmy in prison as a lawyer.

                        Throughout her law career, Kim received praise as a lawyer for being highly skilled at negotiation and devising legal strategies in order to get her clients the best deals possible, though she was sometimes undermined at HHM by Howard Hamlin and Chuck McGill, her former bosses at HHM. After leaving HHM, Kim became the head of Schweikart & Cokely's banking division and hired Kevin Wachtell and Paige Novick from Mesa Verde Bank and Trust as her clients, before quitting the firm and dropping Mesa Verde to focus her attention on pro bono work. She and Jimmy also briefly worked at their own startup law firm Wexler McGill, which consisted of twin solo firms. Outside of the law, Kim had a few part-time jobs including working at Saul Goodman Productions, and also assisted Jimmy with various cons and schemes after being drawn in by Jimmy's cons.
